#+TITLE: Org-Lectures
#+description: A short introduction to the package

* Core Features
Org-Lectures provides a structured and automated system for taking and organizing
lecture notes in Org mode. It streamlines the entire workflow, from creating new
notes to finding old ones, letting you focus on the content.

- *Effortless Organization*: Automatically manages your notes in a clear
  ~course -> lecture~ hierarchy. Create new courses and lectures on the fly.

- *Rapid Navigation*: Interactively search and select courses and lectures
  through a dynamic, aligned minibuffer prompt. An efficient indexing system
  makes access nearly instantaneous.

- *Smart Templates*: New lecture files are automatically populated with relevant
  course data (Professor, Institution, etc.) from a customizable template.

- *Live LaTeX Preview*: Activate a minor mode to get a live-updating PDF of
  your notes. On every save, the Org file is exported to LaTeX and recompiled
  automatically in the background.

* Introduction
This package aims to simplify and automate the mundane task of creating, organizing, and finding
your static notes, allowing you to focus on their actual content. Unlike other widely used packages,
it does not *alter* your established workflow with Org files.

The package maintains a straightforward directory structure within the ~org-lectures-dir~:

1. *Course Index File:* Each course is represented by a ~course_<name>.org~
   file. This file serves as the central index for course-specific information
   and generic notes. It provides an overview of the course but does not
   automatically link to individual lectures.
2. *Course Lecture Directory:* Each course also has a dedicated directory where
   all lecture files for that course are placed.

#+begin_note
I always liked [[https://castel.dev][Gilles]]'s note-taking setup, even though it was not "the right
tool" for me. Working in org not only feels more intuitive but allows me to be
*way* more flexible - I can always publish my lectures in multiple forms, without
really breaking a sweat...

* Installation & Configuration
You can install ~org-lectures~ using ~use-package~. A minimal configuration is shown below.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-lectures
  :straight
  (:host github :repo "chatziiola/org-lectures")
  :config
  (setq org-lectures-dir (expand-file-name "/your/path/to/lectures"))
  ;; Optional: For live LaTeX previews
  (add-hook 'org-lectures-after-open-lecture-hook
	    (lambda (filename)
	      (ignore filename)
	      (org-lectures-latex-minor-mode 1)))
  :general
  ;; Example keybindings using general.el
  ;; Use your own leader keys function
  (lc/leader-keys
    "ll" '(org-lectures-find-course		:which-keys "lecture")
    "lF" '(org-lectures-dired-course-folder	:which-keys "Open course's folder"))
  )
#+end_src

For further customization, please refer to the available variables in the source code.

** Utilizing hooks
~org-lectures~ provides hooks for you to add complementary actions. For example, a hook can be used to automatically start
~org-lectures-latex-minor-mode~ for a continuous PDF preview using ~latexmk~.
#+NAME: hooks example
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'org-lectures-after-open-lecture-hook
	    (lambda (filename)
	      (ignore filename)
	      (org-lectures-latex-minor-mode 1)))

* How to Use It
The main entry point is the interactive function ~org-lectures-find-course~.

1.  *Find or Create a Course*:
   - Call ~org-lectures-find-course~.
   - A minibuffer will prompt you to select a course. You can filter by
     short-title, title, professor, or institution.
   - To create a new course, select the "New Course" option.

2.  *Find or Create a Lecture*:
   - After selecting a course, a second minibuffer appears.
   - You can filter the course's lectures by date, professor, or title.
   - To create a new lecture, select the "New Lecture" option.

The package allows you to easily organize notes, navigate between lectures, and
quickly open a course's directory.

* Literate Source Code
This package is written using literate programming. The complete source code,
including detailed explanations and implementation notes, is available in the
[[file:OrgLectures.org][OrgLectures.org]] file. We encourage you to explore it for a deeper understanding
of the package's inner workings.

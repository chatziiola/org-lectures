#+TITLE: Org-lectures

#+begin_comment
Simplifying and automating the mundane task of creating, organizing, and finding
your static notes so that you can focus on their actual content. It does not
*alter* the way you would otherwise interact with your org files, like other
widely used packages.

I'm keeping this sort because I do not feel like elaborating right now. I'll add
extensive documentation by the end of the week.

* TODOs:
- [ ] Maybe implement classes. This is an obvious example of a program that
  could be improved with OOP.
  - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/Building-Classes.html
- [ ] See ~org-lectures-find-course~ for improvement (quicker course creation)
- [ ] See maybe that you publish the /strange/ keyword library as well, because I
  do not like using it like that in various places
